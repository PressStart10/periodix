2355ffg(sunmoon) was found on planet d-55n universe 211b, was seaming to emit light at night and darkness at day, untill humans were near, swaping its actions, it semes to be a sun, switching from day and night, this was odd, being so close to the sun, the beings charised it, note: none realy LIKED the sun, so this was i guess there resort.
